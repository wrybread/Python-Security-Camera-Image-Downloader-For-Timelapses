# Python-Security-Camera-Image-Downloader-For-Timelapses
A simple Python script to download a static image from a security camera for timelapses.

Saves a static image (http://sinkingsensation.com/cam/saved.jpg) as well as a timestamped version in a directory (http://sinkingsensation.com/cam/timelapse) for building a timelapse later.

I used it to build this timelapse from a Nest Cam:
